                            # the same structure used in the MatLab version)

# =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.

# Load Training Data

# ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
# In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
# neural network parameters.

# ================= Part 3: Implement Predict =================
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.

# ================ Part 4: Sigmoid Gradient  ================
#  Before you start implementing backpropagation, you will first
#  implement the gradient for the sigmoid function. You should complete the
#  code in the sigmoidGradient.m file.

# ================ Part 5: Initializing Pameters ================
#  To learn a two layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start
#  by implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
#  (randInitializeWeights.m)

# =============== Part 6: Implement Backpropagation ===============
#  Now you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for the neural 
#  network. You should add code to nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
#  derivatives of the parameters.
#
print('Checking Backpropagation...')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients

#  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization gradient.
#

# =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
#  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural 
#  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
#  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
#  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
#  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
#

#  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
#  value to see how more training helps.

                                         num_labels, X, y, lambda_value)

# Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
# neural network parameters)
[nn_params, cost] = fmincg(costFunction, initial_nn_params, MaxIter)

# Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
Theta1 = np.reshape(nn_params[0:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)], 
                              (hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1)), order='F')
Theta2 = np.reshape(nn_params[((hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):],
                              (num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1)), order='F')

# ================= Part 9: Visualize Weights =================
#  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by 
#  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in 
#  the data.

print('\nVisualizing Neural Network... \n')

displayData(Theta1[:, 1:])

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue')


# ============= Part 10: Predicting with learned weights =======
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. The already implemented "predict" function is used by
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.
